</h1>

It's PaRappa. But in Unity!

There's not much else to it honestly

Any help we can get would be greately appreciated, as we're just a small team doing this in our free time!\
If you'd like to help, please friend and DM me on Discord ( Junimeek#5738 ), because right now no-one on the team knows how to code in C# lmao

## Usage
If you'd like to edit the game, this project is using [Unity 2021.3.13f1](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2021.3.13), because it was the most convenient version for me to install at the time ðŸ˜‹
