File structure goes something like this:

.../GameData will house all song-specific files, in this structure: game/songName/dataType

For example, the song that plays when youre playing as PaRappa in stage 2 of UJL and you're rappin' bad would be located at Assets/GameData/UJL/FireFire/Songs/PaRappaBad.wav .

In the game/songName directory will house the songName-data.json file (UJL will have two for each MC). This file has all the data for the data directory, song directory, chart, and other relevant data.

Currently, the sprite and scene will all remain hardcoded until we figure out how to unhardcode everything
