Let's get on, Let's get on
Fight the fire, come on now
We gotta put it out quick
That's what I'm talking about
Hold the hose real tight and get ready for a real fight
Give these people a show and then show 'em something that's right
I've been doing this for years, lemme tell you a little something
It's a bit of a rush, and a bit of a dash
Put it on the fire real good, put it out cold and feel good
If you don't think you're the one, fireman's daily work can't be done
We be on a role putting on a show letting people know we're like no other
Water over here and over there so the fire wont spread and go no further
Hold the hose real tight and get ready for a real fight
Give these people a show and then show 'em something that's right
I've been doing this for years, lemme tell you a little something
It's a bit of a rush, and a bit of a dash
Put it on the fire real good, put it out cold and feel good
If you don't think you're the one, fireman's daily work can't be done
Let's get on, Let's get on
Where's the fire? It's out now
OK, that was pretty good
You can go through now
OK, gotta move on!
