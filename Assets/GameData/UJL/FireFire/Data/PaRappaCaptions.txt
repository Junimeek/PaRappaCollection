Uh yes, welcome to the fire
This has been my long desire
Come help me put this out
Bring it down without a doubt
Looking up high and I see all the smoke, you better help me put this out without a choke
Push the button, and just pull the chain, then out comes heavy pouring rain
Squirt it down lower, squirt it up high
Squirt it to the left, and squirt it to the right
Slam the water smack right on the fire, extinguish the flame 'cause that's my desire
Come on now, the fire's almost out, then you're on your way just leave and go about
We be on a role putting on a show letting people know we jam together
Give it all you got with all your might, you better not go down without a fight
Looking up high and I see all the smoke, you better help me put this out without a choke
Push the button, and just pull the chain, then out comes heavy pouring rain
Squirt it down lower, squirt it up high
Squirt it to the left, and squirt it to the right
Slam the water smack right on the fire, extinguish the flame 'cause that's my desire
Come on now, the fire's almost out, then you're on your way just leave and go about
Uh yes, welcome to the fire
Fire's out, I'm not a liar
Time for lunch, yeah I'm out of here
OK, that was pretty good
You can go through now
Hoo, yeah!
